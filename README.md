# Film_Fanatic

## OverView
Film Fanatic is a movie app that allows users to gain information on current movies playing and nearby theaters

## Motivation for App creation
As a student, I saw this application as an achievable solo project that would help grow my Android development skills. The app
contains diverse features such as watching YouTube trailers, leaving movie reviews, and using the Google Maps API. I felt that
if I was able to successfully implement all of these desired features, the development process would serve as a great 
opportunity for learning new skills and reinforcing old ones. 



## Features
- User account creation using Parse
- List of movies currently playing in theaters is viewed using The Movie Database
- User can see a description of each movie, who the director is, and leading roles
- Users can watch a Youtube trailer of each of these movies using a YouTubePlayer
- Users can leave a review for any movie they would like to as well as see reviews left by other app users
- Users can save movies they would like to see to their "Wishlist"
- Google Maps used to show user's location and a list of nearby theaters both on the map and in a list
- Users can see a picture of each theater and see real Google reviews, for each theater, on the app itself
- Users can load each theater's website or phone number directly from the app
